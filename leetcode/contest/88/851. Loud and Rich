//for this problem,you must care that
//we use dfs to find all of nodes which are richer than orginal
//you must care that you should use visited arry, in order to prevent loop in graph
//when you use visited, that means it not easy for you to solve sub problems
//because graph of this problem contains circle, child should consider parent's value
//but if you use visited, when you reach out to child, child couldn't visit parent
//that means, child current result is not contains parent, so we shouldn't cache it.
//this is a very important details. because, if graph don't exist circle,
//we know that we can solve sub problem and cache the result for example think it as a tree
//but graph is more complicate than tree
//that means when we need to clear visited array, every time we need to calculate next ans.
